The dataset includes 1617 images.
Dents-carcorrosion are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Fit (black edges))
* Auto-contrast via contrast stretching

The following augmentation was applied to create 4 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -15° to +15° horizontally and -15° to +15° vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.5 percent of pixels

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -15° to +15° horizontally and -15° to +15° vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.5 percent of pixels
